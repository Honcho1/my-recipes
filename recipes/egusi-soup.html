    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Egusi Soup is a hearty and creamy dish made with ground melon seeds
      (egusi), which gives the soup its signature texture and nutty flavor. It
      is commonly prepared with a variety of leafy vegetables like spinach, ugu,
      or bitter leaves, and enriched with meats such as beef, goat, or fish. The
      addition of palm oil, peppers, and other local spices brings out a bold,
      savory flavor. Egusi Soup is typically enjoyed with pounded yam, fufu, or
      eba, making it a wholesome and satisfying meal.
