    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Yam and Egg Stew is a simple yet flavorful Nigerian dish that combines
      boiled yam with a savory egg-based tomato stew. The yam, usually cut into
      chunks and boiled until tender, serves as the perfect base for the stew,
      which is made with sautéed onions, tomatoes, peppers, and eggs, often
      spiced with seasonings like thyme, curry, and garlic. This combination
      creates a balanced meal that is both filling and delicious, typically
      enjoyed as a breakfast or light lunch.
