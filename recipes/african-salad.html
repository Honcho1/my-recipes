    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Abacha, also known as African Salad, is a traditional delicacy from
      Eastern Nigeria, particularly popular among the Igbo people. This salad is
      made from shredded cassava tubers, which are dried and rehydrated before
      being mixed with palm oil, potash, garden eggs, and a variety of spices.
      Abacha is often enjoyed as a light meal or snack and can be served with
      fish, ugba (oil bean), and other proteins. The dish is known for its
      tangy, savory taste and crunchy texture, making it a refreshing and unique
      Nigerian meal.
